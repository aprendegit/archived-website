I'm archiving the old wordpress website. Apparently, the posts are still useful 
even though they are quite old already so instead of just delete it,
I'll keep a static version of it. This should make it easier to maintain
(less money spent on hosting and less time keeping wordpress updated and protected
from attacks).

I downloaded a static version using httrack and I'm replacing 
wordpress with it. That should be enough to keep the post 
available.
